## Introduction

- A simple Pokémon battle game created using JavaScript and the audio library Howler.js. In this game, you can choose a random Pokémon and battle against another random Pokémon. The objective of this project was to improve my JavaScript skills while developing a fun game to play.

- I downloaded the audio files from https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/audio/cries/. Using the Howler.js library, I was able to integrate these sound effects into the game.
- Main things used: Flexbox, Grid, JavaScript, and Howler.js
